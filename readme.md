## What is this?

This extension allows you to export birthdays from your snapchat friends to your calendar, in ICAL format.
It works by intercepting the fetch requests on https://snapchat.com/web and extracting the friends list from the response,
then it lets you select which birthdays you want to export and finally it lets you download the ICAL file.
